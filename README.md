### TITLE : IOT-BASED-HOME-AUTOMATION
### Home Automation Using Arduino, Picsimlab, and Blynk

#### Overview
This project demonstrates a simulated home automation system using an Arduino board, the Picsimlab simulator, and the Blynk IoT mobile application. The system enables remote control and monitoring of key household components, such as lighting, temperature control, and water tank management. This setup is designed to emulate real-world home automation, providing a practical and interactive experience.

#### Features
- **Remote Control:** Manage lights, heating/cooling systems, and water tank levels through the Blynk mobile app.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** View live data from sensors on the Blynk app and a CLCD screen.
- **Automation:** The Arduino board automates tasks based on sensor inputs, such as adjusting light brightness, controlling room temperature, and managing water levels in the tank.

#### Components
- **Arduino Board:** Central unit that processes sensor data and controls actuators.
- **Picsimlab Simulator:** A simulation environment for testing the system without physical hardware.
- **Blynk IoT Application:** Mobile app used for remote control and monitoring.
- **Sensors:**
  - **LDR Sensor:** Adjusts garden light brightness based on sunlight.
  - **LM35 Temperature Sensor:** Monitors and displays room temperature.
  - **Serial Tank Sensor:** Manages and monitors water levels in the tank.

#### How It Works
1. **Lighting Control:** The LDR sensor reads ambient light levels, adjusting garden lights accordingly via Arduino.
2. **Temperature Control:** The LM35 sensor monitors temperature, with the system controlling a heater or cooler based on user settings via the Blynk app.
3. **Water Management:** The Serial Tank sensor monitors water levels, controlling the inlet and outlet valves through commands sent from the Arduino, which are triggered by the Blynk app.

#### Components
1. **Arduino IDE:** We used the Arduino IDE to write and upload code to the Arduino board, allowing us to control and automate the home automation tasks.
2. **Picsimlab:** This tool was used to simulate the home automation system, enabling us to test the project virtually without the need for physical hardware.
3. **Null-modem Emulator:** We utilized this emulator to create a serial interface between the Arduino board and other device emulators, facilitating communication during the simulation.
4. **Blynk App:** The Blynk IoT app was installed on a smartphone, where we set up widgets to remotely control and monitor the home automation system in real time.
5. **Code Upload:** The provided Arduino code was uploaded to the board, allowing us to run the simulation and test the various automated features of the system.

#### Usage
- Use the Blynk app to control and monitor the system in real time.
- Observe the CLCD screen for direct feedback and status updates.
- Experiment with different automation scenarios to see how the system responds to sensor inputs and user commands.

#### Conclusion
This project is a comprehensive introduction to home automation using Arduino. By simulating a real-world environment, it provides a hands-on approach to learning about IoT, automation, and embedded systems.
