# IOT-BASED-HOME-AUTOMATION
Home Automation Using Arduino, Picsimlab, and Blynk
Overview
This project demonstrates a simulated home automation system using an Arduino board, the Picsimlab simulator, and the Blynk IoT mobile application. The system enables remote control and monitoring of key household components, such as lighting, temperature control, and water tank management. This setup is designed to emulate real-world home automation, providing a practical and interactive experience.

Features
Remote Control: Manage lights, heating/cooling systems, and water tank levels through the Blynk mobile app.
Real-Time Monitoring: View live data from sensors on the Blynk app and a CLCD screen.
Automation: The Arduino board automates tasks based on sensor inputs, such as adjusting light brightness, controlling room temperature, and managing water levels in the tank.
Components
Arduino Board: Central unit that processes sensor data and controls actuators.
Picsimlab Simulator: A simulation environment for testing the system without physical hardware.
Blynk IoT Application: Mobile app used for remote control and monitoring.
Sensors:
LDR Sensor: Adjusts garden light brightness based on sunlight.
LM35 Temperature Sensor: Monitors and displays room temperature.
Serial Tank Sensor: Manages and monitors water levels in the tank.
How It Works
Lighting Control: The LDR sensor reads ambient light levels, adjusting garden lights accordingly via Arduino.
Temperature Control: The LM35 sensor monitors temperature, with the system controlling a heater or cooler based on user settings via the Blynk app.
Water Management: The Serial Tank sensor monitors water levels, controlling the inlet and outlet valves through commands sent from the Arduino, which are triggered by the Blynk app.
Installation and Setup
Install Arduino IDE: Ensure the Arduino IDE is installed on your computer for programming the Arduino board.
Picsimlab Setup: Download and configure the Picsimlab simulator to simulate the system environment.
Blynk App: Install the Blynk IoT app on your smartphone and set up the required widgets for controlling the home automation system.
Code Upload: Write or upload the provided Arduino code to your board and begin simulation/testing.
Usage
Use the Blynk app to control and monitor the system in real time.
Observe the CLCD screen for direct feedback and status updates.
Experiment with different automation scenarios to see how the system responds to sensor inputs and user commands.
Conclusion
This project is a comprehensive introduction to home automation using Arduino. By simulating a real-world environment, it provides a hands-on approach to learning about IoT, automation, and embedded systems.
